% Linear regression
%
% INPUTS:
%   X      TxN matrix of signals, where T is the # samples and N is # of signals
%   G      TxK matrix of predictors where K is the number of modeled predictors
%   addDoF additional degrees of freedom that are not included in the
%          design matrix, e.g. when multiple design matrices
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   B    regression cofficients of the model predictors.
%   R2   real-valued relative response amplitude, e.g. dF/F
%   Fp   p-value of each predictor computed from t-distribution
%   dof  degrees of freedom in residual based on autocorrelation
